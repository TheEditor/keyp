## Quick Start

### Initialize your vault
```bash
$ keyp init
Enter master password: ●●●●●●●●
Confirm master password: ●●●●●●●●
✓ Vault initialized successfully!
```

### Store a secret
```bash
$ keyp set github-token
Enter master password: ●●●●●●●●
Enter value for "github-token": ●●●●●●●●
Enter master password to save: ●●●●●●●●
✓ Secret "github-token" saved
```

### Retrieve a secret (copies to clipboard)
```bash
$ keyp get github-token
Enter master password: ●●●●●●●●
✓ Copied to clipboard (clears in 45 seconds)
```

### List all secrets
```bash
$ keyp list
Enter master password: ●●●●●●●●

  • api-key
  • database-url
  • github-token

3 secrets stored
```

### Delete a secret
```bash
$ keyp delete github-token -f
Enter master password: ●●●●●●●●
Delete secret "github-token"? (y/N): y
✓ Secret "github-token" deleted
Remaining secrets: 2
```

## Why keyp?

Unlike enterprise secret managers (too complex) or traditional Unix password managers (too arcane), **keyp** is designed for the way modern developers work:

- ✅ No GPG complexity
- ✅ No cloud account needed
- ✅ No team features bloat
- ✅ Just simple, secure secret storage

## Getting Started

### 1. Install keyp

```bash
npm install -g @theeditor/keyp
```

Verify installation:
```bash
keyp --version
```

### 2. Create your vault

```bash
keyp init
```

You'll be prompted to create a master password. This is the only password you need to remember.

### 3. Store your first secret

```bash
keyp set github-token your-token-here
keyp set api-key sk_live_abc123xyz
keyp set db-password secure-password
```

### 4. View all secrets

```bash
keyp list
```

### 5. Retrieve a secret

```bash
keyp get github-token
# Copied to clipboard! (auto-clears in 45 seconds)
```

### 6. (Optional) Sync to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize Git sync
keyp sync init https://github.com/username/keyp-backup.git

# Push your vault
keyp sync push

# On another machine, pull to sync
keyp sync pull
```

## Installation

### Via npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @theeditor/keyp
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm 8.0.0 or higher

### Platform Support

- ✅ macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Debian, etc.)
- ✅ Windows (10/11, including WSL)
